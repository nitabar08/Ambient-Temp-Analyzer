Ambient Temperature Analyzer
Overview
This project, developed by Accuweather, is an ambient temperature analyzer web and mobile application designed to provide users with real-time insights into their room's temperature based on local weather data and mobile phone battery temperature. The application utilizes the Accuweather API for fetching local temperature data and showcases the information through an intuitive graphical interface.

Features
Dynamic Data Fetching: The application fetches local temperature data from the Accuweather API and attempts to obtain laptop battery temperature information through server-side logic.

Simplified Structure: All project files are kept in a single folder for simplicity.

Environment Variables: Sensitive information, such as API keys, is managed using environment variables for improved security. The dotenv module is used to handle these variables.

Express Middleware: The server utilizes Express middleware to handle routes and serve static files, simplifying the server-side code.

Battery Temperature Challenges: Due to limitations in fetching laptop battery temperature directly from a web application, the project currently uses a placeholder for laptop battery temperature data.

Graphical Representation: The graphical representation of local temperature and laptop battery temperature (or placeholder data) is implemented using Chart.js, but challenges exist in accurately plotting laptop temperature data.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for web) / React Native (for mobile), Chart.js
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Dependencies: Chart.js, Electron, Express, Systeminformation
